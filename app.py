DESCRIPTION = """
I am a third-year student at the University of Windsor currently pursuing a Bachelor of
Computer Science degree and actively looking for coop opportunities. I have started my 
computer science journey back in 2021 at the highest ranked private university of 
Bangladesh, infamously known as Independent University, Bangladesh, until I transferred 
to University of Windsor for a better hands-on learning experience. As a volunteer in a 
systems administration position, I am currently working for DEFEND, a tech company known
for making technologies that are focused primarily on authentication systems for the safety 
of vulnerable people. Similarly, it has been a great Fall 2023 semester as I was a teaching
assistant for a data structure and algorithms course at the University of Windsor where 
I taught 100+ students how to apply Java in various data structure problems. 
Fun fact: I am a big fan of C++, but my projects are based on Python. Personally, 
I believe I make the best chicken stew, I love listening to R&B and soft rock, and on 
weekends, I enjoy riding my E Scooter at night."""
